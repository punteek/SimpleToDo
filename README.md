# SimpleToDo

This To-Do List application was built to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To run this application, simply clone/download the repository and open `index.html`
with a browser. The user should be able to add new items (by clicking the `+` button),
delete current items (by hovering a To-Do and pressing the red button), and mark completed
To-Do's by clicking on the text to strike-through.
